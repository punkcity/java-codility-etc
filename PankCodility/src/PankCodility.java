 * This is the main class for the project "PankCodility" where I will cover solutions for the problems on Codility.
 * The main purpose of this project is to learn and practice the problem solving skills.
 * These problems are taken from the website "https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/".
 * The solutions are written purely based on my approach and understanding in Java. Just like there are multiple ways
 * to solve a problem, there are multiple ways to write a solution.
