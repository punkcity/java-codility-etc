/**
 * PankCodility
 * This is the main class for the project "PankCodility" where I will cover solutions for the problems on Codility.
 * The main purpose of this project is to learn and practice the problem solving skills.
 * These problems are taken from the website "https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/".
 * The solutions are written purely based on my approach and understanding in Java..WELL...CORRECTION...Using COPILOT as well.
 *    My goal has now slightly changed - I want to compare my approach with the AI-based Copilot from GitHub.
 *    Idea is to be efficient and learn from the AI. AI generated solution has been consistently better than mine!!!
